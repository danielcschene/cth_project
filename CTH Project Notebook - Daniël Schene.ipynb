    "Social media, in the broadest sense of the word, has become a permanent and increasingly vital platform of communication, branding and self-representation for a wide variety of institutions, communities and companies. Universities are no exception, and previous research in (mainly) the marketing area points to these HEIs' (Higher Educational Institutions) role as active \"brands\". For instance, Palmer et al. (2016), Belanger et al. (2014), Balaji, Roy & Sadeque (2016) and Peruta & Shields (2018) (among others) all point out that due to an increasingly competitive global environment in the educational sector, but also because of (as we have seen at the UvA, which comprises an ongoing debate about financing) both political and market-based demands, universities are gravitating towards marketing strategies with students in the \"consumer-role\". Universities have to distinguish themselves from similar institutions not merely by academic excellence and scholarship quality, but also by creating an online presence, identity and brand which ties in with the institution at large. An overview of this \"institutional branding\" can be found in Belanger et al. (2014). Williams & Omar (2013) provide a throrough summary of HEIs' considerations and motives behind increased branding efforts and strategies. While part of these changing strategies are, so to speak, mandatory, with HEIs having to partake whether they want to or not, social media platforms also provide them with new ways of creating a certain identity, as mentioned. Fujita et al. (2018) investigated the online efforts of HEIs to enhance membership relations and experience, as well as identity creation, by mining HEI Facebook pages as well as surveying student populations. They found that through the co-creation of content and interaction that a platform such as Facebook provides, institutions increase member engagement and identification with the institution, and thus the \"brand\". In other words, these social media platforms have both an obligatory component as well as an opportunity component (which needn't be entirely seperate) in the context of HEIs' presence on social media platforms. These findings corobborate those of Clark et al. (2016), in which they argue that investment in social-media presence and marketing is vital for maintaining and also building relationships of HEIs with both their students and other stakeholders. \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of social media platforms by HEIs is therefore an interesting, if somewhat novel research area (the social media age is, arguably, only soon arriving at the end of its first decade). A small overview of previous findings follows. Brech et al. (2017) found that universities with a large fan-base on Facebook had lower levels of online user-engagement than smaller HEI pages. Furthermore, the relative interactivity of users with an HEI page increases with the length of posts. A third finding is that a university's reputation in terms of ranking (the paper uses the Times Higher Education Ranking) positively influences fan-base size on Facebook, leading to prestigious HEIs having an online network (and reach) way beyond the number of, for instance, enrolled students, which also strengthens their online market position and presence. Rutter, Roper & Lettice (2016) investigated Facebook and Twitter content of HEIs and found that, for instance, the aquisition of a large Twitter-following is (significantly) associated with recruitement (of new students) succes. Also the content type and level of interactivity and responsiveness of an HEI on social media play a role in both recruitment and online brand and community relations. Peruta & Shields (2018) point out that the post frequency of HEIs is associated with user-engagement levels, in that more posts generally result in less engagement (as mentioned in the first paragraph). They provide further evidence for the content of a Facebook post being more important or indicative of user-engagement than frequency of posts. Also, certain topics covered in the posts (such as athletics, news-related posts, admissions) showed a higher degree of user-engagement than other topics (campus-related, academic events). Lastly, their provide evidence for photos being the best way of increasing fan-engagement, corroborating previous findings in the field. \n",
    "\n",
    "As becomes apparent in this overview, this field of research is quite young and not a lot of content-based studies of social media posts by HEIs have been conducted (although I have, logically, not been able to cover the whole field). Lastly, a study by Kumar et al. (2018) uses VADER sentiment analysis to investigate different news outlets and their presence on social media. While media institutions/channels are not the same as universities, a similar pattern of increasing use of marketing-based strategies is arguably present in both. They both use social media in the ways described previously in this review, to esablish identity, community values and relationships with stakeholders and members, while they also rely on social media for branding and recruitement of potential new members. This current research project follows a similar trajectory, so a short review of the findings in the above mentioned paper is provided here. Some interesting findings, and also potentially useful for the present paper, include that posts with higher degrees of positive or negative sentiment evoke the most attention from users. Furthermore, the sentiment of the posts is indicative of the sentiment of the comments on these posts in that they tend to be similar (positive posts generally receive positive comments). Also, negative posts receive more comments, while positive posts receive more likes. \n",
    "\n",
    "While no individual, cristal-clear research question follows from this litarature review, a more general way of describing the present paper and its aims may be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Are there noticable differences or distinctive features in the use of Facebook and the content of pages by Dutch universities, and if so, what are they? These may be investigated in terms of:\n",
    "\n",
    "   -Comment counts and like counts to different types of posts\n",
    "\n",
    "   -Emotions in reactions, in general and by post type or content\n",
    "\n",
    "   -Sentiment of posts and of comments\n",
    "\n",
    "   -Differences in frequently used words or key concepts as proxies of imporant topics/values of the HEIs\n",
    "\n",
    "   -Correlations of social-media use or features with enrollment numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "   -Correlations of the ranking or \"quality\" of an HEI with social-media use \n",
    "\n",
    "This paper will explore and set out to answer some of these questions, and is in that sense a work-in-progress, and will probably keep this status (proudly) at the end. "

    "The Facebook pages of four Dutch universities are the sources of this paper's data. These include two universities in the \"randstad\", namely the University of Amsterdam and Utrecht University, which are also two relatively large universities. The other two are the Radboud University in Nijmegen and Twente University. These are smaller universities, as well as being located outside of the randstad. These differences between institutions provide both a somewhat heterogeneous sample, as well as possibilities of comparing them by these different traits. \n",

    "# 4. Conclusions and Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some preliminary findings in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Infinitely more explorations of this data is possible, and this will definitely be further investigated beyond the scope of this report. However, the analyses above, while giving us some insight into the use of Facebook by the chosen Dutch universities, are also to exemplify the learned skills and research tools in the Coding the Humanities course. It goes without saying that many of these scripts can be used to explore or compare other variables within and outside of the data provided here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concerning the set of research questions this paper set out to answer, or at least to give this a shot, what follows is a short recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "What seems to be the case, at least in part, is that the more posts an HEI produces, the less the engagement turns out to be. This is examplified by the UT having been the most active on facebook by far, but also having the lowest level of engagement by far. For the 883 updates it has posted throughout a two year period, an average of 1.86 comments per post, and a mean engagement ratio of 28.28 both suggest that more content decreases engagement. This is also supported by the numbers for the Radboud, which is the least active of all universities with 338 posts in the two year period, yet it still has an average of 16.23 (the runner up) comments per post. Furthermore, both photos and links appear to be the most engagement-inducing, and also the most used, types of posts. This ties in with the founding of previous research in that the HEIs have to compete for engagement online more and more, and that they try to do this by posting certain types of content. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second finding, even though the dataset is very small, is that the ratio of engagement an HEI achieves on Facebook may play a role in the recruitement of new BA students. This is just one of many factors, but as this papers concerns itself with social media data, we do not look beyond this at the moment. It also appears to be the case that visual content (videos and photos) are received and reacted to most positively by users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean sentiment compound score of posts by the HEIs show a somewhat strange pattern in that the larger a university is in terms of total students, the less positive its posts score in terms of sentiment. The UvA has the largest student body, and a mean sentiment score of 0.31. The second largest university, the UU, has a score of 0.42, followed by the third largest HEI, the Radboud, with a sentiment score of 0.43, and the smallest university, the UT, has the highest sentiment score, namely 0.45. This might be explained along the lines of small universities having to rely more on their social-media outlets to recruit new students (the UT is also the smallest in terms on new BA students, while it posts the most of all universities). \n",
    "\n",
    "Another findings is that post content having something to do with the student body is received with less love reactions and engagement than other types of posts, for instance the geographical location of a university. It becomes clear that, in the case of the UU, posts about Utrecht elicit higher degrees of engagement than posts which do not contain this word. Also, posts about or including Utrecht are generally more sentiment-laden than other posts, and this is also the case for posts about or including students. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper and project were of course mainly created and conducted to get some hands-on experience with online data analysis. It is far from perfect, and one of its setsbacks is the small sample. Generalisation with a sample of only 4 pages is impossible, and statistical analysis is even less meaningful. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second point is that the project definitely lacks direction; I had some scenarios in mind, but was unable to pin it down to a clear, demarcated RQ in the end. This is both a weakness and an advantage; for me in terms of the learning experience and curve, it is actually quite useful. I hope it shows some examples of what I have learned in the course, and I think a further investigation of universities' facebook usage is actually really interesting, and something I'm going to continue to work on. The lack of direction caused me to do analyses more in an wandering way, choosing what seemed interesting (and still related to the initial research topics) while this also makes the notebook a bit chaotic maybe. \n",
    "\n",
    "A third weakness is in terms of the DMIs combined with the pages I chose to mine data from. While I expected all universities to post their messages in English, a lot of posts were in Dutch and this complicated the sentiment analyses conducted on the posts. Obviously VADER is not made to recognize whether a post is in English or not, and it returned some random scores or 0 scores for posts which were in Dutch. These scores also make the data flawed and less usable and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though I tried to combine some elements of the course while also providing some new code, there are many options of comparison, combination and analysis which I have not done in this project. A more in-depth look at the comments would have been very interesting, especially when comparing post sentiment with comment sentiment, for instance. Another interesting feature would have been post length and even more complex kinds of parsing or tagging of the posts, and relate these to some of the more salient features. I also did not do anything with the ranking data, just to name something, which I regret but simply did not have space for.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all this is a field of research which is still young, as I've definitely come to know through my review of some of the literature, and this provides so many exciting options. Even though this project was small and perhaps a bit shallow at times, I do feel like I've been exposed to the possibilities these kinds of data open up."
